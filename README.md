# Econ-and-Data-Science-
73-265 Econ &amp; Data Science 

Course Description: This course is at the intersection of economic analysis, computing, and statistics. It develops foundational skills in these areas and provides students with hands-on experience in identifying, analyzing, and using data to solve real-world problems in economics and business. In this course we will be using the statistical programming language R, which is a powerful open-source language that is widely used. In this very hands-on, data-centric, course, students will learn the basics of data manipulation, how to visualize, present and interpret data related to economic and business activity by employing statistical analysis and various visualization techniques. Through many interactive exercises, students will develop a foundation for data-driven decision making. This course also provides a solid base for future courses such as Econometrics I and II (73-274/275) that provide a rigorous treatment of more advanced methods used for business, economics, and public policy. 

Learning Objectives: By the end of the course, students should be able to

Develop competence in the statistical programming language R;
Work with raw datasets using R;
Describe and visualize data using R;
Perform various statistical analyses to address economic questions;
Interpret the estimates from these statistical analyses;
Effectively communicate findings with both technical and non-technical audiences.
